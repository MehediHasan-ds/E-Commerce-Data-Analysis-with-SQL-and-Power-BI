# E-Commerce Data Analysis Plan

This project outlines a comprehensive set of analyses to be performed on an e-commerce dataset, ranging from basic metrics to advanced business intelligence and predictive modeling.

### Simple Analyses

### Intermediate Analyses
8. **Customer Purchase Behavior**

11. **Payment Issues**  
    - What is the rate of failed or pending payments (payment_status)?  
    - How does payment_method correlate with payment_status?  
    - Are there patterns in payment failures by customer segment or order size?

12. **Customer Session Behavior**  
    - What is the average session_duration and pages_visited per session?  
    - How does device_type or browser impact session_duration or order conversion?  
    - Are there differences in session behavior between high- and low-spending customers?

13. **Geographic Sales Analysis**  
    - Which cities/states/countries generate the highest/lowest revenue?  
    - How does order_source (e.g., online, app, in-store) vary by geographic region?  
    - Are there regions with high customer registrations but low order volumes?

14. **Discount Impact**  
    - How does discount_applied correlate with order volume or total_amount?  
    - Are there products or categories where discounts lead to higher sales?  
    - What is the relationship between discount_applied and customer retention?

### Complex/Advanced Analyses
15. **Customer Segmentation**  
    - Can customers be clustered based on demographics, purchase frequency, and session behavior?  
    - Which customer segments have the highest lifetime value (LTV)?  
    - How do high-LTV customers differ from low-LTV customers in behavior and preferences?

16. **Cohort Analysis**  
    - What is the churn rate of customers (no orders after a certain period)?  
    - Are there patterns in churn by demographics, order_source, or product preferences?  
    - How does session behavior (e.g., pages_visited, session_duration) predict churn?

17. **Product Recommendation Opportunities**  
    - Which products are frequently purchased together (market basket analysis)?  
    - Are there subcategory_id combinations that could be bundled to increase sales?  
    - How do reviews (rating, review_text) influence subsequent purchases of similar products?

18. **Pricing Strategy Analysis**  
    - How does price elasticity vary across products or categories?  
    - Are there products where a price increase/decrease could optimize revenue?  
    - How does the gap between cost and price impact sales volume?

19. **Customer Acquisition Analysis**  
    - What is the cost of acquiring customers (based on order_source and first order)?  
    - Which order_source channels yield the highest retention or LTV?  
    - Are there seasonal patterns in customer acquisition by region?

20. **Supply Chain Efficiency**  
    - How does supplier_id performance correlate with stock_quantity and delivery_date?  
    - Are there products with frequent stockouts that impact sales?  
    - What is the relationship between added_date and sales velocity?

21. **Funnel Conversion Analysis**  
    - What is the conversion rate from customer_sessions to orders?  
    - How do pages_visited and session_duration impact conversion rates?  
    - Are there specific device_type or browser combinations with lower conversion rates?

22. **Predictive Sales Modeling**  
    - Can historical order data predict future sales by product or category?  
    - What factors (e.g., discounts, reviews, stock) most strongly predict order volume?  
    - How accurately can customer demographics predict repeat purchases?

23. **Cross-Channel Behavior Analysis**  
    - How does customer behavior differ across order_source (e.g., app vs. website)?  
    - Are there customers who use multiple channels but have low order frequency?  
    - How does session behavior on different devices impact order completion?

24. **Anomaly Detection**  
    - Are there outliers in order_amount, discount_applied, or shipping_cost that indicate errors or fraud?  
    - Which customers exhibit unusual session behavior (e.g., extremely short/long sessions)?  
    - Are there products with unexpected sales drops despite high stock and good reviews?

These analyses range from descriptive (simple) to predictive and prescriptive (complex), covering customer behavior, product performance, operational efficiency, and strategic opportunities. Each question or scenario is designed to uncover potential problems or growth levers for the company.
